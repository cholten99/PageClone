// This JS file is used by the Help Guy original page and the new tab it opens

// Start by polling to see if Needs Help person wants help - poll ever 2 seconds?
// If they do want help, open a new tab - load HelpGuyTab.html

// In the new tab load the HTML from the Needs Help guy (needs to be cached at the server) (after convert from widgets to read only)

// Then start polling for updates from the Needs Help guy page (how often?)
// On receiving an update, make the appropriate changes on HelpGuyTab.html
