1) One line of javascript include
2) Load other JS on the fly - see http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/loadjavascriptcss.shtml to load jQuery and then http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
3) Remotely display pages - all form entries set to read only on the far end : $('#myFormID :input').attr('readonly','readonly');
4) Tricky to connect in either direction due to issues in "finding" each other - skip for proof on concept
5) Click on "share my page" button, load jQuery and other JS (see above), open tab on remote machine (must have already existing session?), send all current HTML content to the remote page plus scroll down position (remote page gets via a poll?), render page in an iFrame on remote tab (with $.load()? ) including making forms read-only, add appropriate event handlers (including page scroll), on event trigger send even to equivalent object on remote page

Note : See this for getting form element names and values - http://pietschsoft.com/post/2006/06/01/Javascript-Loop-through-all-elements-in-a-form.aspx

TBD:
1) The stuff in turning up in HEAD in the remote tab is wonky - causing errors in console.log - stripped out for now
2) Put "TBD:" in places that need work
3) Make all form elements on the remote tab read-only - see http://jsfiddle.net/j5PAn/
4) Copy all the form contents (for every type of widget) over
5) Handle links from remote page (if on same site follow, if external site remote viewing tab shows what happened)
6) Create event handlers and sender
7) UID based / numbered server-side event cache
8) Poll for events in remote tab and process (in correct order)
